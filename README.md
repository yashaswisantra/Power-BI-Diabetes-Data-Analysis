# Power-BI-Diabetes-Data-Analysis

About Dataset: This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes
based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females
at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.2 From the data set in the (.csv) File We can find several variables, some of them are independent (several medical predictor variables) and only one target dependent variable (Outcome).

Based on the Diabetes Patient Analysis dashboard, here are key insights:
1.	Health Metrics: 
o	Average Blood Pressure: 69.1
o	Average BMI: 32 (indicating obesity)
o	Average Diabetes Pedigree Function: 0.47
2.	Age-related patterns: 
o	BMI is highest in the 41-50 age group (19%)
o	Diabetes Pedigree Function is highest in the 21-30 age group (51%)
o	Glucose and Insulin levels are highest in the 21-30 age group
3.	Pregnancy data: 
o	Total pregnancies recorded: 768
o	Highest average pregnancies in the 41-50 age group (27.69%)
o	Inverse relationship between number of pregnancies and BMI/Insulin levels
4.	Blood Pressure and Glucose: 
o	Glucose levels peak at two blood pressure points (around 50 and 100)
o	Highest glucose reading is about 7.3K
5.	Age distribution: 
o	All age groups from 21 to 60+ are represented
o	Significant representation across 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, and 51-60 age groups
6.	BMI distribution: 
o	Fairly even distribution across age groups, with slightly higher percentages in 41-50 and 51-60 ranges

These insights suggest a complex interplay between age, BMI, pregnancy history, and diabetes indicators. The data shows that younger patients (21-30) have high diabetes risk factors despite lower BMI, while middle-aged groups have higher BMI but varied diabetes indicators. This information could be valuable for tailoring diabetes prevention and management strategies for different age groups.
